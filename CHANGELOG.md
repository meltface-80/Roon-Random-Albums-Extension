# Changelog

All notable changes to Roon Random Albums are documented here.

## [1.5.51] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Label fragmentation (Inc. / LLC variants)** — stripping a corporate suffix (e.g. `Inc.`) from `"A&M Records, Inc."` left a trailing comma that blocked the next pass from stripping `"Records"`, producing group key `"amrecords"` instead of `"am"`. Trailing punctuation is now stripped after *each* suffix pass, so `"A&M Records, Inc."` correctly merges with `"A&M Records"` and `"A&M"`.

## [1.5.50] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Label fragmentation** — trailing commas (and semicolons/colons) in file-tag label names (e.g. "A&M Records,") now stripped before suffix normalisation, so "A&M Records," and "A&M" correctly merge into one tile.
- **Discogs logo auth** — logo search was using key/secret as query params rather than the `Authorization: Discogs key=…, secret=…` header used by the working label-data fetch; switched to the header, which Discogs requires for authenticated API calls.
- **Discogs placeholder filter** — added `no-label` pattern to the image filter regex to catch Discogs' own "no image" CDN URL.
- **Discogs logo diagnostics** — completion log now breaks down result counts: logos found / no results / placeholder filtered / errors, so problems are visible in the scan log without enabling debug mode.

## [1.5.49] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Discogs label logos** — after Fan Art TV finishes (which requires a MusicBrainz MBID), a second logo pass now searches Discogs by label name and fetches `cover_image` URLs. This covers the large number of labels that have no MBID and therefore no Fan Art TV logo. Results are cached in SQLite alongside Fan Art TV logos. Placeholder/spacer images are filtered out. Runs in the background after every scan and on startup.

## [1.5.48] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **Label text size increased** — bumped from 8cqw to 9cqw.

## [1.5.47] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **Label text tiles: consistent font size across all tiles using container query width** — removed per-label JS font-size calculation entirely. Font is now `8cqw` (8% of the tile's own width), so "Rockproduktionen" (16 letters) fits with thin margins and every other label uses that same size. Scales automatically with tile width on any screen size.

## [1.5.46] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Label text tiles: font size now scales by longest word, not word count** — the previous approach made 4 short words ("3 Beads of Sweat") smaller than 2 long words. Font is now sized to fit the longest word in the label name, so the tile width is always the constraining factor. Short words at any count display larger; only genuinely long words (e.g. "Rockproduktionen") force a smaller size.

## [1.5.45] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Label tiles still showing album covers** — labels without a Fan Art TV logo were falling back to the first album's cover art, making the tile indistinguishable from an album. Removed the album-art fallback from label tiles entirely. The display hierarchy is now: Fan Art TV logo → label name text. Nothing else.

## [1.5.44] — 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **Label tiles without a logo now show the label name** — previously showed a generic tag icon. The label name is displayed centred in the tile, with each word on its own line (e.g. "Blue Note" = two lines, "Warner Music Group" = three lines). Font size scales down slightly for longer names. The tag icon is retired entirely from label tiles.

## [1.5.43] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Progress bar shows >100%** — albums that fail one API pass and cascade to the next (e.g., fail iTunes → TheAudioDB → MusicBrainz) were counted once per pass, so `done` grew to 3× the album count and the percentage climbed to 112%+. Replaced the single `done` counter with a pass-weighted progress function: files+iTunes share 0–20%, TheAudioDB 20–50%, MusicBrainz 50–80%, Discogs 80–100%. The bar now moves linearly through each pass and always stays between 0% and 100%.

## [1.5.42] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Progress bar frozen during passes 2–4** — `done` was only incrementing inside the iTunes pass. TheAudioDB, MusicBrainz, and Discogs passes now update progress correctly so the UI percentage moves throughout the full scan.
- **No visibility into long-running passes** — the log only wrote at pass boundaries, making it impossible to tell if TheAudioDB (potentially 37+ minutes) was stuck or just slow. Now logs every 100 albums processed within each pass.
- **TheAudioDB could block for hours on timeout storms** — added a circuit breaker: 10 consecutive request errors in any pass abort that pass immediately and log the reason. The next 12-hour auto-rescan retries. Reduced TheAudioDB timeout from 10s to 6s so stalled requests fail faster.

## [1.5.41] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Scan error logging** — all scan events (start, per-pass summaries, errors, completion) are now written to `data/labels-scan.log` with timestamps. The log rotates automatically at ~100KB.
- **Scan log download** — a "Download scan log" and "Copy log" link appears in the Labels view after a scan, for easy sharing when debugging.
- **12-hour auto-rescan** — the labels scan now re-runs automatically every 12 hours while paired with a Roon Core, so new albums are picked up without a manual rescan.
- **`GET /api/labels-scan-log`** — serves the scan log as a plain-text download.

### Changed
- **Rate-limit errors now abort silently** — when iTunes returns 429/403, the error is recorded in the log and the pass aborts; the next scheduled 12-hour window will retry rather than erroring again in the same run.

## [1.5.40] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **iTunes rate limiting** — reduced concurrency from 20 to 3 parallel requests and added a 500ms delay between batches. On the first 429 or 403 response the entire iTunes pass is aborted immediately rather than continuing to hammer a blocked endpoint; remaining albums fall through to TheAudioDB and MusicBrainz.
- **File labels now override stale cache** — when file metadata scanning is enabled, the file label is now compared against every existing cache entry. Where the file tag disagrees with the cached API result, the file wins and the cache is updated. Previously file labels only applied to albums with no cache entry at all.

## [1.5.39] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **TheAudioDB rate limiting** — the free API has a strict rate limit; added 1.1s delay between requests and changed from 5 concurrent to serial to stop HTTP 429 errors.
- **MusicBrainz timeouts** — increased request timeout from 8s to 20s to handle slow MB responses without aborting.
- **File scan silent failure** — added a debug log when `parseFile` can't be resolved from music-metadata, replacing a silent early return that made it impossible to diagnose.
- **"Independent" treated as a label** — added `independent` to the non-label filter so it's rejected at all sources and never shown in the labels view or looked up in Fan Art TV.

### Changed
- **Update check interval** — reduced from every 6 hours to every 7 days. Updates are still checked on startup; the Settings page manual check is unaffected.

## [1.5.38] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **File metadata scanner: wrong directory structure assumed** — the previous scanner expected strict `Artist/Album/tracks` nesting. Real libraries use mixed layouts (flat `Artist - Album/`, year-prefixed folders at root, proper nested `Artist/Album/` alongside each other). The scanner now recursively walks the music directory and matches on audio file tags (`common.album` + `common.albumartist`) rather than directory names, so naming convention is irrelevant.

## [1.5.37] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **File metadata scanning** — the extension can now read LABEL/ORGANIZATION tags directly from your audio files when the music directory is mounted read-only in Docker (`-v /path/to/music:/music:ro`). File tags are the most authoritative source and are checked first, before any network API. Add `-v /mnt/dietpi_userdata/4tb/Music:/music:ro` to your `docker run` command to enable.
- **Discogs label source** — restored as a final-pass fallback for albums no other source could identify. Runs serially at 1 req/sec to respect the rate limit.
- **TheAudioDB label source** — added as a third-pass source between iTunes and MusicBrainz. Free, no key required, runs 5 concurrent requests.
- **`/api/music-mount` endpoint** — reports whether the `/music` directory is mounted and what path is configured.

### Fixed
- **Label fragmentation by country/region** — labels like "[PIAS] America", "[PIAS] Belgium", "Universal Music Canada", "Universal Music France" now all group correctly under "[PIAS]" and "Universal Music" respectively. A new regex strips country and regional qualifiers (US, UK, America, Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, and 30+ others, plus International, Global, Nordic, etc.) before computing the group key.
- **Management company false positives** — album entries where iTunes (or another source) returned a management or booking company instead of the actual label (e.g. "Velvet Hammer Music and Management" for Korn) are now detected and skipped. Existing bad entries are evicted from the SQLite cache on startup.

### Changed
- **Label scan pipeline** — now a 4-pass pipeline: file metadata → iTunes (20 concurrent) → TheAudioDB (5 concurrent) → MusicBrainz (serial) → Discogs (serial). Each album is only sent to subsequent passes if the previous pass found nothing.

## [1.5.36] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Missing `.dockerignore`** — without it, `COPY . .` in the Dockerfile was baking the native install's `node_modules` into the Docker image, overwriting the clean ones built by `npm install`. Also excluded `config.json`, `data/`, tarballs, and `.git` from the image.
- **Migration instructions** — updated to use a fresh separate directory for the Docker build, making cleanup unambiguous: the old native directory can be safely `rm -rf`'d without any risk of deleting Docker build files.

## [1.5.35] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Downgrade / rollback via web UI** — the in-app updater now follows whatever version is marked as "latest" on GitHub, regardless of direction. If the latest release is rolled back to an older version number, the app will offer to install it. The toast and Settings button both indicate "Roll back" vs "Update" so there's no ambiguity.
- **Release notes in update UI** — when an update or rollback is available, the GitHub release notes are shown directly in the update toast and under the "Check for updates" button in Settings, so you can read what changed before tapping.

### Fixed
- **Incorrect "Listening statistics" feature in README** — removed from the features list; the stats UI was removed in a previous build (play history still exists in the backend and is used by Play Unheard and Random Album Radio).

## [1.5.34] — 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **Labels scan: two-pass strategy** — iTunes lookups now run first in batches of 20 (fast, no rate limit). Only albums iTunes misses are passed to MusicBrainz, which runs serially to respect the 1.1-second rate limit. Reduces total scan time for large libraries.
- **Library stats: served from in-memory index** — `/api/library-stats` now reads directly from `albumIndex.count` instead of walking the Roon browse hierarchy on each request. Eliminates the 60-second cache and the background Roon API call entirely.
- **Artist view re-entry guard** — calling `showArtistAlbums()` while already in artist view now exits cleanly before rebuilding, preventing stale grid/count state.

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed `fetchLabelFromDiscogs()`, `discogsWait()`, the unused `_albumCountCache` variable, the `buildSimpleTile()` fallback function, and the stale Qobuz-data comment block. Removed dead CSS rules: `.brand`, `.brand-mark`, `.brand-logo`, `.brand-name`, `.filter-grid`, `.filter-grid .filter-row`, `.filter-loading`, `.filter-backdrop`.

### Fixed
- **`.count-text` missing from CSS** — the class used in the artist view count bar was referenced in JS but absent from the stylesheet; added the rule.

## [1.5.33] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Random Album Radio auto-starts on restart** — eliminated the bug where radio would begin playing automatically whenever Roon or the extension restarted. Root cause: any `zones_changed` event for a zone in "stopped" state (with empty queue) after the 15-second grace window would trigger playback. Replaced the unreliable grace timer with proper state-transition detection: a "play" command is now only issued when the extension observes an actual `playing → stopped` transition for a zone (i.e. the queue genuinely ran out). A zone that is already stopped when first seen after a reconnect will never auto-start. Enabling radio explicitly via the UI still starts playback immediately as expected.

## [1.5.32] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Phone portrait grid** — restored 3×3 (9 albums) layout. The CSS override that forced 2 columns has been removed; the base 3-column grid now applies correctly to all phone portrait views.

## [1.5.31] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Roon extension publisher** — changed `extension_id` from `com.local.*` to `com.musicd.*` so Roon's Extensions list now shows "MusicD" instead of "Self".
- **Now-playing album link** — tapping the album name on the Now Playing screen no longer triggers "Valid offset query parameter required". The handler now only opens the album detail when a valid index match with an offset is found; otherwise shows a brief toast.
- **Labels screen flickering** — eliminated the blank-then-reload flash that occurred every 4–5 seconds while the label scan was running. Skeletons are only shown on the first open; subsequent polls only re-render when the label count actually changes.
- **Share card text size** — increased release-date label (20 → 26 px), album title (48 → 56 px), and artist (30 → 37 px) for better readability.
- **Share card MusicD wordmark** — removed the "MusicD" text fallback from the share card.
- **Play unheard tooltip** — removed `title` attribute from the compass button; the text tooltip no longer appears on tap.
- **Grid album counts** — corrected `computeAlbumCount()`: desktop now returns 45 (9 × 5), tablet portrait returns 20 (5 × 4); tablet landscape (7 × 3 = 21) and phone portrait (2 × 3 = 6) unchanged.

### Added
- **Album count in topbar** — the total number of albums in your library (or the active filter) is now shown as a bold label on the left side of the topbar, white on dark and black on light.

### Changed
- **Labels scan speed** — increased concurrent iTunes lookup batch from 6 to 20 albums, significantly reducing scan time for large libraries.

## [1.5.30] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **"Play unheard" in topbar** — the compass icon button (⊙) is now in the main
  header alongside Filter, Labels, and Search, so it's always one tap away without
  opening Settings. Removed from the Settings sheet.

### Changed
- **Now-playing album title is tappable** — the album name shown on the Now Playing
  screen is now a button. Tapping it opens the full album detail view (tracks and
  actions) for the currently playing album.

### Fixed
- **Tap-to-select disabled globally** — iOS and Android no longer show the text
  selection handles when tapping album tiles, labels, or any non-interactive text.
  Text selection is still active in the search input and any other text fields.

## [1.5.29] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Smart random radio** — the random-album radio now prefers albums not played
  in the last 30 days. It picks candidates in small batches and skips recently
  heard titles, falling back to pure random only when nothing fresh is found.
- **Play something unheard** — new button in Settings (and `POST /api/play-unheard`)
  that picks an album with zero plays in the plays table and starts it immediately
  in the selected zone. Falls back to pure random if your entire library has been
  heard at least once.
- **Play count badges** — album tiles now show a small "N×" badge in the
  bottom-right corner for any album that appears in the plays table, so you can
  see at a glance which albums you've listened to before.
- **Recently played in stats** — the stats panel now shows a "Recently played"
  section (last 25 tracks, regardless of whether the play was marked completed).
  This section is visible immediately, even before any completed-play statistics
  have accumulated, so the stats page is never blank after the first track starts.
- **Zone breakdown in stats** — plays-per-zone bar chart shown when more than
  one zone has play history.
- **Apple Shortcuts / HTTP automation endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/shortcut/zones` — returns all Roon zones with name, ID, and state.
  - `GET /api/shortcut/play-random?zone=ZONENAME` — plays a random album in
    the named zone. Accepts both display name and zone ID.
  - `GET /api/shortcut/play-unheard?zone=ZONENAME` — plays an unheard album in
    the named zone.

### Fixed
- **Stats page no longer crashes when `labelsDb` queries fail** — the `/api/stats`
  endpoint is now wrapped in `try/catch` and returns a proper JSON error instead of
  an unhandled exception.
- **Stats page shown even before any completed plays** — previously the page
  returned a plain text message and rendered nothing. Now the recently-played
  section populates as soon as any track starts playing.

## [1.5.28] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Random album radio auto-start after Roon restart** — after the initial
  `Subscribed` snapshot (which correctly passes `isInitial=true`), Roon fires
  additional `zones_changed` events as it settles its state. These arrived
  without `isInitial`, causing stopped zones with radio enabled to auto-start.
  Added a 15-second grace window (`RECONNECT_GRACE_MS`) stamped on every
  `Subscribed` event; "play" decisions are suppressed within this window.
- **MusicD logo missing in header** — `logo.jpg` was never committed to the
  repository. Replaced the broken `<img>` with an inline SVG text wordmark.
- **MusicD wordmark missing on share cards** — `logo.png` was similarly absent.
  The share card now renders "MusicD" as text in the bottom-right corner when
  no image is available.

## [1.5.27] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Listening statistics never recorded** — `scrobbleUpdate` read
  `now_playing.line1 / line2 / line3` directly, but Roon nests those strings
  inside `now_playing.three_line.line1` etc. The guard `np && np.line1` was
  always falsy, so zero plays were ever written to SQLite and the stats page
  showed nothing. Fixed to use the same `three_line` / `one_line` property
  paths already used elsewhere (e.g. the transport API endpoint).

## [1.5.23] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Random album radio auto-start on restart** — when the extension reconnected
  to Roon, the initial zone-state snapshot was treated the same as a live zone
  change. Any zone with radio enabled that was stopped/idle would immediately
  start playing. The `"Subscribed"` event (startup snapshot) now passes
  `isInitial=true` to `handleRadioZone`, which suppresses the `"play"` decision
  so a stopped zone is left alone on reconnect. Queue top-up for zones that are
  already playing is unaffected — seamless continuation still works.

## [1.5.22] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Stats panel transparent background** — `var(--bg-page)` was used but never
  defined, causing the stats screen to show the album grid through it.
  Corrected to `var(--bg)`, the app's standard page background colour.

## [1.5.21] — 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Statistics** — moved from the topbar bar-chart icon into the Settings panel.
  Tap *View stats* in Settings to open the full-screen stats view. The ✕ button
  in the top-right corner of the stats screen returns you to the album grid.

### Removed
- **Heart / love button** — removed. The Roon browse API did not expose a love
  action at the album browse level (button was always greyed-out and untappable).
  Use `/api/debug/album-items?offset=N` if you want to investigate the browse
  structure for a future re-implementation.

## [1.5.20] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Heart / love button** — relocated from the top-right corner of the modal
  to sit inline next to the artist name, so it's always visible alongside the
  album info rather than floating over the cover art.
- **Heart button persistence** — button stays visible when Roon's browse API
  hasn't returned a love state yet; it appears greyed/disabled rather than
  disappearing, making the loading state obvious.
- **Heart browse reliability** — the server now searches inside every nested
  action_list returned by Roon's album browse level (not just the top-level
  items), so the love action is found even when Roon places it inside a
  sub-group. All browse items are now logged unconditionally (docker logs will
  show the full structure for diagnosis if needed).
- **Debug endpoint** — added `GET /api/debug/album-items?offset=N` which dumps
  the raw browse items Roon returns when entering an album, making it easy to
  diagnose browse API structure issues without code changes.
- **Updater 415 error** — POST requests to `/api/update/apply`,
  `/api/update/check`, and `/api/album/love` now send `Content-Type: application/json`.
  iOS Safari was supplying an implicit content type on body-less POSTs that
  Express's json() middleware rejected with 415 Unsupported Media Type.

## [1.5.19] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Listening statistics** — tap the bar-chart icon in the topbar to open your
  stats. Plays are captured server-side via the Roon zone subscription, so
  every track played from any zone (extension UI or Roon app) is recorded
  automatically, even with the browser closed.
  - **At a glance**: total plays, unique albums/artists, replay %, busiest
    day, peak listening hour
  - **Top 10 albums** — with cover art and play count
  - **Top 10 tracks** — by play count  
  - **Top artists** — percentage bar chart of listening share
  - **By decade** — breakdown of what era you listen to most
  - **By genre** — populated as the label scan enriches albums (iTunes returns
    genre alongside label data, stored in `album_meta` table)
  - **Time of day** — 24-hour sparkline showing listening patterns
  - **Day of week** — bar chart
  - Stats accumulate from this version onwards; no historical Roon data is
    imported. Genre/decade data fills in gradually as albums are label-scanned.

## [1.5.18] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Love / heart button** — a ♥ button appears in the album modal. Tapping it
  loves or unloves the album via Roon's browse API, reflected immediately in
  Roon's own UI and usable in Focus. The button is pink/filled when loved and
  hidden for albums that don't support it (e.g. not in your library).

## [1.5.17] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Transport bar persistence** — the mini bar was being hidden by two
  defensive `bar.classList.add("hidden")` calls: one when the zone selector
  was momentarily empty on page load (race with zone population), another on
  any API error. Both now return early without touching bar visibility. The
  bar is only hidden when Roon definitively reports nothing is playing for the
  selected zone, so it stays visible through network hiccups and page loads.

## [1.5.16] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Artist name link** — artist name in the album modal is now always a
  clickable link. Previously it flashed blue on open then reverted to plain
  text because the detail-fetch response was overwriting the button with a raw
  text node. A dedicated `setModalArtist()` helper is now used consistently
  everywhere the subtitle is set.
- **Wrong album opened for offset-shifted entries** — if the album index has a
  stale offset (e.g. after adding albums to the library), the detail fetch
  could return a completely different album and overwrite the modal title and
  artist with wrong data. The returned title is now compared to the expected
  title and ignored if it doesn't match, keeping the correct header while
  the user can trigger a re-index to restore full consistency.

## [1.5.15] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Roon extension settings** — removed duplicate version label (version is
  already shown in the Roon panel header). Changed the "Check for updates"
  dropdown placeholder from "—" to "No action" for clarity.

## [1.5.14] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Artist album links** — artist names in the album detail modal are now
  clickable. Tapping opens a filtered grid showing all albums by that artist:
  primary releases at the top, albums they appear on below.
- **Roon extension settings: per-zone radio toggle** — the random-album-radio
  switch for each zone is now also available inside Roon's own extension
  settings panel, so you can toggle it without opening the web UI.
- **Roon extension settings: Check for updates** — a *Check for updates* action
  in Roon's extension settings triggers an immediate update check.

### Changed
- **Label scan speed** — iTunes Search API is now the primary label source
  (free, no API key, returns `recordLabel` directly). MusicBrainz is used as
  a fallback. Scans now run 6 albums concurrently, reducing scan time from
  ~17 minutes to ~2–3 minutes for a 1 000-album library.

## [1.5.13] — 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **Share card** — redesigned to 1200×600. Album art now fills the entire left
  half (600×600, full bleed, no padding). Year, title and artist are vertically
  centred in the right half with even breathing room. A subtle dark gradient
  feathers the art-to-text boundary. Wordmark pinned to the bottom-right corner.

## [1.5.12] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Settings info icons** — help text replaced with a small ⓘ button on each
  settings row. Tapping it shows a toast that auto-closes after 5 seconds or
  on any tap, freeing up space in the settings panel.
- **Transport bar persistence** — the mini transport bar now restores its last
  known track title and artist from `localStorage` immediately on page load,
  so it appears before the first poll completes after a restart or update.

### Fixed
- **Radio zone persistence across container recreation** — the random-album-radio
  toggle state is now also saved to `data/cache/settings.json` inside the Docker
  volume, so it survives `docker stop`/`docker rm`/`docker run` cycles. Roon's
  own config is still updated as a secondary copy for backward compatibility.
- **In-app updater** — a `v1.5.12` git tag is now pushed to GitHub so the
  built-in updater can detect and install future releases without manual Docker
  intervention.

## [1.5.11] — 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **SQLite label database** — the three JSON cache files (`labels-cache.json`,
  `labels-mbid.json`, `labels-logo.json`) are replaced by a single
  `data/cache/labels.db` SQLite database. Writes are immediate and ACID;
  no more debounce timers or risk of partial writes on crash. Existing JSON
  caches are migrated automatically on first startup and deleted.
- **docker-compose.yml** now declares a named `roon-data` volume mounted at
  `/app/data`. Running `docker-compose up -d` is the recommended install/upgrade
  path and guarantees label data is never lost across rebuilds.
- **Dockerfile** installs `python3 make g++` so `better-sqlite3` compiles
  correctly during `docker build`.

### Fixed
- Label database (`data/cache/`) is now correctly preserved by the in-app
  updater's skip list. Upgrading via the settings cog no longer risks losing
  scan results.

## [1.5.10] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Label cache persistence** — label name, MusicBrainz MBID, and Fan Art TV
  logo caches are now written to `data/cache/` and excluded from the update
  overlay. Once built, the label database survives in-app updates without
  rescanning.
- **Docker volume for `data/`** — the Dockerfile now declares `VOLUME /app/data`
  and the docker run command mounts a named volume (`roon-random-albums-data`),
  so the cache and Roon pairing persist even when the container is removed and
  rebuilt.

### Changed
- **Fan Art TV logo fetches run 5 at a time** instead of sequentially with a
  500 ms delay. A library with 200 unique labels that all have MBIDs now
  finishes logo fetching in ~8 seconds instead of ~100 seconds.

## [1.5.9] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Check for updates** button in the settings cog — tap it to trigger an
  immediate update check without restarting the container.
- **Docker migration banner** — native (non-Docker) installs now see an
  amber banner with copy-ready commands to switch to the Docker version.
  Dismissed permanently once you tap *Got it*.
- `is_docker` field on the `/api/update/status` API response so the UI can
  distinguish Docker from native installs.

### Changed
- **Share card** — fixed height (1200 × 592); release date, album title, and
  artist are now spaced evenly within the cover area. Title and artist both
  wrap up to 3 lines. No review section, no label in the meta line.
- README rewritten as Docker-only. Includes fresh-install steps for v1.5.9,
  upgrade steps from v1.5.8, and native-to-Docker migration instructions.

### Fixed
- In-app updater (`tar` extraction) now works correctly inside Docker/Alpine
  containers — `shell: true` ensures `tar` is found on PATH when the update
  is applied.
- Dockerfile installs `tar` explicitly and sets `ENV DOCKER=1` so the
  migration banner is correctly suppressed for Docker users.

## [1.5.8] — 2026-06-16

Initial Docker release. Packaged as a self-contained `*-docker.tar.gz`
with Dockerfile, all source files, and in-app self-update support via
GitHub Releases.
