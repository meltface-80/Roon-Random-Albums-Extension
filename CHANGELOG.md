# Changelog

All notable changes to Roon Random Albums are documented here.

## [1.5.9] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Check for updates** button in the settings cog — tap it to trigger an
  immediate update check without restarting the container.
- **Docker migration banner** — native (non-Docker) installs now see an
  amber banner with copy-ready commands to switch to the Docker version.
  Dismissed permanently once you tap *Got it*.
- `is_docker` field on the `/api/update/status` API response so the UI can
  distinguish Docker from native installs.

### Changed
- **Share card** — fixed height (1200 × 592); release date, album title, and
  artist are now spaced evenly within the cover area. Title and artist both
  wrap up to 3 lines. No review section, no label in the meta line.
- README rewritten as Docker-only. Includes fresh-install steps for v1.5.9,
  upgrade steps from v1.5.8, and native-to-Docker migration instructions.

### Fixed
- In-app updater (`tar` extraction) now works correctly inside Docker/Alpine
  containers — `shell: true` ensures `tar` is found on PATH when the update
  is applied.
- Dockerfile installs `tar` explicitly and sets `ENV DOCKER=1` so the
  migration banner is correctly suppressed for Docker users.

## [1.5.8] — 2026-06-16

Initial Docker release. Packaged as a self-contained `*-docker.tar.gz`
with Dockerfile, all source files, and in-app self-update support via
GitHub Releases.
