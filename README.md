# Random Albums + Labels — a Roon extension v1.6.29

A web UI that shows a screenful of random albums from your Roon library, with instant whole-library search, playback actions targeting any zone, and more.

> The Roon API does not let third-party code navigate the Roon app itself, so the album detail view (art, tracks, action buttons) is rendered inside this UI. Tapping **Play Now** still plays through Roon on the zone you select.

---

## Features

- **Home** — lands on curated rows instead of a single grid: albums you haven't played in 6 months (with a daily Album of the Day pick), a fresh random shuffle, the Label of the Week, and a Browse by Genre grid; tap any row's header to open its full-screen view, or jump to the classic random album wall any time from the menu
- **Global search** — always available from the Home top bar; instant whole-library results (Artists, Labels, Albums) plus, as they load, matches from the Qobuz and Tidal catalogues (when connected — tap to open that service's browser ready to favourite) and from Pitchfork's recent reviews (tap for the score and a link to the review on pitchfork.com)
- **Pitchfork magazine** — a full-page browser of Pitchfork album reviews (Latest Reviews + Best New Music) as a woven cover-art mosaic with scores and BNM badges; tap a review to read it on pitchfork.com, open the album in your library, or find it on Qobuz/Tidal
- **Album detail** — full track listing with **individual track selection** (tap any track to play it now or add just that track to the queue), album play/queue actions, release year, label link, editorial review, and Pitchfork score where available; multiple artists are shown as individual tappable links; the view carries the Home screen's look with a blurred glow of the album cover behind the artwork
- **Now Playing** — full-screen now-playing view that always fits your display (the album art scales to the space available), with transport controls, a Queue tab, and a one-tap Home button; bracketed track details get their own line
- **Wall display** — a Roon-style always-on screen at `http://<server-ip>:3399/display` for any tablet or TV browser: follows the playing zone and rotates between album art, artist photos (FanArt.tv), an album review, an artist bio, "more from this artist / label" cover grids drawn from your own library (tap a cover to play or queue it), and the track's official music video, muted and synced (optional — needs a free YouTube API key). Tap the screen for mode chips to pin any view; a Nest-Hub-style progress strip sits along the bottom. On/off toggle and rotation-speed slider in Settings
- **Play unheard** — one tap to find and play an album you haven't listened to in the last 12 months (including anything never played); falls back to pure random once your whole library has been heard recently
- **Random Album Radio** — automatically queues a new random album when your queue runs dry, preferring albums not recently played
- **Record labels** — browse your library by label, with logos from FanArt.tv and Discogs where available; includes Self-Released and Independent, plus a featured Label of the Week on Home
- **Label merge** — consolidate duplicate or variant label tiles into one; undo individual merges at any time
- **Multi-select** — long-press to select multiple album tiles and play or queue them all at once
- **Filters** — narrow the random pool by genre, decade, tag, or label
- **Artist view** — tap any artist name to see all their albums in your library
- **Share card** — generates a 1200×600 PNG of the current album, ready to share
- **In-app updater** — checks for new releases automatically; install with one tap from Settings

## Setting up Discogs, FanArt.tv and YouTube API keys

Both are free and significantly improve label logo coverage.

### Discogs personal access token

Discogs is used to find label names for albums that iTunes and MusicBrainz miss, and to fetch label logos.

1. Sign in (or register free) at [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Developers** → click **Generate new token**
3. Copy the token
4. In the extension, tap the gear icon → paste into **Discogs token** → tap **Save**

### FanArt.tv API key

FanArt.tv provides high-quality label logos for labels that have a MusicBrainz MBID.

1. Register free at [fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv/get-an-api-key/#personal) for a personel API token
2. login or register
3. follow onscreen prompts (or come back here after registering/login and click on above link)
4. Copy the key shown there
5. In the extension, tap the gear icon → paste into **FanArt.tv key** → tap **Save**

### YouTube API key

Optional: Getting a YouTube Data API v3 key (free)

1. Go to console.cloud.google.com and sign in with any Google account.
2. Create a project: click the project dropdown (top bar) → New project → name it anything (e.g. “MusicD Display”) → Create, and make sure it’s selected.
3. Enable the API: menu → APIs & Services → Library → search “YouTube Data API v3” → open it → Enable.
4. Create the key: APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create credentials → API key. Copy the key shown.
5. (Recommended) Click Edit API key → under “API restrictions” choose Restrict key → tick only YouTube Data API v3 → Save. This makes the key useless for anything else if it ever leaks.
6. Paste the key into MusicD → Settings → YouTube API key → Save.
   
No billing account is needed — the free quota (10,000 units/day) comfortably covers a home display: each new track costs about 100 units, and results are cached, so that’s roughly 90+ fresh tracks per day before it would ever pause until midnight (Pacific time), when the quota resets.

---

> **Note on label accuracy** — an album may appear under a label that differs from the one shown in the album view. This could be correct: many albums could be released under multiple labels simultaneously (for example, Daughtry's *Baptized* was released under 19 Recordings, RCA, and Sony Music). The extension shows whichever label your file tags or the scan sources attribute to the album in the case of being a Qobuz or Tidal version.

---

## Install (Docker)

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/roon-random-albums
cd /opt/roon-random-albums
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/releases/download/v1.6.29/roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz
docker build -t roon-random-albums:1.6.29 .
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
# remove the below line (and this line) if you only use Qobuz/Tidal
  -v /your/path/to/Music:/music:ro \
  roon-random-albums:1.6.29
```

`--network host` is required so the extension can discover your Roon Core on the local network. The `-v roon-random-albums-data` flag mounts a named Docker volume so that your Roon pairing, play history, and label cache survive container rebuilds. The `-v .../Music:/music:ro` flag mounts your music directory read-only so the extension can read label tags directly from your files — this is optional but gives the most accurate label data. Adjust the path to match your music library location.

You should see the extension appear in **Roon → Settings → Extensions** under **MusicD**. Click **Enable**, then browse to `http://<your-server-ip>:3399`.

### Install Docker

If Docker isn't installed yet:

```bash
# DietPi
sudo dietpi-software install 162

# Debian / Ubuntu
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

## Updating

```bash
sudo docker stop roon-random-albums
sudo docker rm roon-random-albums
sudo rm -f /opt/roon-random-albums/roon-random-albums-vPREVIOUS-docker.tar.gz
cd /opt/roon-random-albums
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/releases/download/vNEW/roon-random-albums-vNEW-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-vNEW-docker.tar.gz
docker build -t roon-random-albums:NEW .
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
# remove the below line (and this line) if you only use Qobuz/Tidal
  -v /your/path/to/Music:/music:ro \
  roon-random-albums:NEW
```

## Migrating from a native install

If you're running an older native (non-Docker) install, the app will show a migration banner automatically with copy-ready commands. Or follow these steps.

```bash
# 1. Stop the native service
sudo systemctl stop roon-random-albums
sudo systemctl disable roon-random-albums

# 2. Create the build directory and download the tarball
sudo mkdir -p /opt/roon-random-albums
cd /opt/roon-random-albums
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/releases/download/v1.6.29/roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz

# 3. Build and run
docker build -t roon-random-albums:1.6.29 .
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
# remove the below line (and this line) if you only use Qobuz/Tidal
  -v /your/path/to/Music:/music:ro \
  roon-random-albums:1.6.29
```

Confirm the extension appears in **Roon → Settings → Extensions** before removing the old install.

### Cleaning up the old install

```bash
# Remove the service file
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/roon-random-albums.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Remove the old native install directory (find it first if unsure)
find / -name "roon-random-albums" -type d 2>/dev/null
rm -rf /path/to/old/roon-random-albums
```

Your Roon pairing, listening history, and label cache are all safe — they live in the Docker volume (`roon-random-albums-data`).

# MacOS installs as follows

For macOS, the main requirement is to install Docker Desktop first, since Docker is not included with the operating system.

## 1. Install Docker Desktop
• Download Docker Desktop for Mac from:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
(Ensure you’re installing the correct version for Mac or Intel chips)
• Open the downloaded .dmg.
• Drag Docker.app into your Applications folder.
• Launch Docker from Applications.
• Grant any permissions macOS requests.
• Wait until Docker Desktop reports Engine running (the whale icon in the menu bar will stop animating).
• Verify Docker is installed:

```
docker --version
docker compose version
```

You should see version information for both commands.

## 2. Download and build the extension
Open Terminal and run:

```
mkdir -p ~/roon-random-albums
cd ~/roon-random-albums
curl -L -o roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz \
https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/releases/download/v1.6.29/roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-v1.6.29-docker.tar.gz
docker build -t roon-random-albums:1.6.29 .
```

## 3. Run the container
If you use local music replace /Users/yourusername/Music with the folder containing your music library. Note: add your Roon server IP. 

```
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3399:3399 \
  -e ROON_CORE_IP=<IP_OF_YOUR_ROON_CORE> \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
  -v /Users/yourusername/Music:/music:ro \
  roon-random-albums:1.6.29
```

Or if you only use Qobuz or TIDAL

```
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3399:3399 \
  -e ROON_CORE_IP=<IP_OF_YOUR_ROON_CORE> \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
  roon-random-albums:1.6.29
```

## 4. Open the extension
In your browser, go to: (don’t forget to use your Roon server IP address)

`http://<your.server.IP>:3399`

Please let me know if you run into any trouble.

## Configuration

| Env var      | Default   | What it does |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| `PORT`       | `3399`    | HTTP port the UI listens on |
| `RRA_DEBUG`  | —         | Set to `1` for verbose logging |
| `MUSIC_DIR`  | `/music`  | Path where your music library is mounted inside the container |

Pass extra env vars with `-e` in the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d ... -e RRA_DEBUG=1 roon-random-albums:1.6.29
```

### Album metadata sources

No keys required for basic operation. The extension pulls in external metadata from:

- **Release year** — MusicBrainz (free, public API)
- **Label name** — file tags → Bandcamp (for Bandcamp purchases) → iTunes → TheAudioDB → MusicBrainz → Discogs (each free; Discogs needs a personal access token for best results)
- **Label logo** — FanArt.tv (requires free API key) → Discogs (requires personal access token)
- **Editorial review** — Qobuz public album page, falling back to Wikipedia
- **Artist bio** — Wikipedia

## Troubleshooting

- **"Waiting for Roon Core" never goes away**
  → Roon → Settings → Extensions → click **Enable** on *Random Albums*.
- **Extension shows "self" instead of "MusicD"**
  → Update to v1.5.31 or later.
- **Play Now does nothing**
  → Confirm a real zone is selected in the Settings dropdown.
- **"No zones available"**
  → No active outputs visible to Roon yet. Wake a device or pick one in Roon's own remote first.
- **Labels page shows no logos**
  → Add your Discogs token and FanArt.tv key in Settings (gear icon), then tap Force rescan.
- **Discogs token save doesn't stick**
  → Ensure the field shows your token in plain text before tapping Save. If it still fails, check `docker logs roon-random-albums` for a confirmation line.
