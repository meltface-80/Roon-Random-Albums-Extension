## Setting up Discogs, FanArt.tv and YouTube API keys

Both are free and significantly improve label logo coverage.

### Discogs personal access token

Discogs is used to find label names for albums that iTunes and MusicBrainz miss, and to fetch label logos.

1. Sign in (or register free) at [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Developers** → click **Generate new token**
3. Copy the token
4. In the extension, tap the gear icon → paste into **Discogs token** → tap **Save**

### FanArt.tv API key

FanArt.tv provides high-quality label logos for labels that have a MusicBrainz MBID.

1. Register free at [fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv/get-an-api-key/#personal) for a personel API token
2. login or register
3. follow onscreen prompts (or come back here after registering/login and click on above link)
4. Copy the key shown there
5. In the extension, tap the gear icon → paste into **FanArt.tv key** → tap **Save**

### YouTube API key

Optional: Getting a YouTube Data API v3 key (free)

1. Go to console.cloud.google.com and sign in with any Google account.
2. Create a project: click the project dropdown (top bar) → New project → name it anything (e.g. “MusicD Display”) → Create, and make sure it’s selected.
3. Enable the API: menu → APIs & Services → Library → search “YouTube Data API v3” → open it → Enable.
4. Create the key: APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create credentials → API key. Copy the key shown.
5. (Recommended) Click Edit API key → under “API restrictions” choose Restrict key → tick only YouTube Data API v3 → Save. This makes the key useless for anything else if it ever leaks.
6. Paste the key into MusicD → Settings → YouTube API key → Save.
   
No billing account is needed — the free quota (10,000 units/day) comfortably covers a home display: each new track costs about 100 units, and results are cached, so that’s roughly 90+ fresh tracks per day before it would ever pause until midnight (Pacific time), when the quota resets.

---

> **Note on label accuracy** — an album may appear under a label that differs from the one shown in the album view. This could be correct: many albums could be released under multiple labels simultaneously (for example, Daughtry's *Baptized* was released under 19 Recordings, RCA, and Sony Music). The extension shows whichever label your file tags or the scan sources attribute to the album in the case of being a Qobuz or Tidal version.

---

## Install (Docker)

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/musicd-remote
cd /opt/musicd-remote
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/MusicD-Remote/releases/download/v1.6.35/MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz
tar -xzf MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz
docker build -t musicd-remote:1.6.35 .
docker run -d \
  --name musicd-remote \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v musicd-remote-data:/app/data \
# remove the below line (and this line) if you only use Qobuz/Tidal
  -v /your/path/to/Music:/music:ro \
  musicd-remote:1.6.35
```

> **The `musicd-remote-data` volume holds your Roon pairing, play history, and label cache — never rename it once created.** Point every future `docker run` at the same name and everything carries over; a different name makes Docker silently create a fresh empty volume (new pairing, lost history). **Upgrading from v1.6.31 or earlier?** Your data lives in the old `roon-random-albums-data` volume — move it once with the copy step in [Updating](#updating) below before using this command.

`--network host` is required so the extension can discover your Roon Core on the local network. The `-v musicd-remote-data` flag mounts a named Docker volume so that your Roon pairing, play history, and label cache survive container rebuilds. The `-v .../Music:/music:ro` flag mounts your music directory read-only so the extension can read label tags directly from your files — this is optional but gives the most accurate label data. Adjust the path to match your music library location.

You should see the extension appear in **Roon → Settings → Extensions** under **MusicD**. Click **Enable**, then browse to `http://<your-server-ip>:3399`.

### Install Docker

If Docker isn't installed yet:

```bash
# DietPi
sudo dietpi-software install 162

# Debian / Ubuntu
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

## Updating

> **Coming from v1.6.31 or earlier (the Roon-Random-Albums days)?** Two one-time steps before the update commands below:
>
> 1. **Stop and remove the old container name**: `sudo docker stop roon-random-albums && sudo docker rm roon-random-albums` (and use the new `/opt/musicd-remote` folder below — the old `/opt/roon-random-albums` folder can be deleted afterwards).
> 2. **Move your data to the new volume name** — your Roon pairing, play history, and label cache live in the old `roon-random-albums-data` volume; copy them once into `musicd-remote-data`:
>
> ```bash
> sudo docker run --rm \
>   -v roon-random-albums-data:/from \
>   -v musicd-remote-data:/to \
>   alpine sh -c "cp -a /from/. /to/"
> ```
>
> Skip step 2 and the new container starts with an empty volume: Roon asks you to authorize again and your history is gone. (Once you've confirmed everything carried over, the old volume can be removed with `sudo docker volume rm roon-random-albums-data`.)


```bash
sudo docker stop musicd-remote
sudo docker rm musicd-remote
sudo rm -f /opt/musicd-remote/MusicD-Remote-vPREVIOUS.tar.gz
cd /opt/musicd-remote
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/MusicD-Remote/releases/download/vNEW/MusicD-Remote-vNEW.tar.gz
tar -xzf MusicD-Remote-vNEW.tar.gz
docker build -t musicd-remote:NEW .
docker run -d \
  --name musicd-remote \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v musicd-remote-data:/app/data \
# remove the below line (and this line) if you only use Qobuz/Tidal
  -v /your/path/to/Music:/music:ro \
  musicd-remote:NEW
```

## Migrating from a native install

If you're running an older native (non-Docker) install, the app will show a migration banner automatically with copy-ready commands. Or follow these steps.

```bash
# 1. Stop the native service
sudo systemctl stop roon-random-albums
sudo systemctl disable roon-random-albums

# 2. Create the build directory and download the tarball
sudo mkdir -p /opt/musicd-remote
cd /opt/musicd-remote
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/MusicD-Remote/releases/download/v1.6.35/MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz
tar -xzf MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz

# 3. Build and run
docker build -t musicd-remote:1.6.35 .
docker run -d \
  --name musicd-remote \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v musicd-remote-data:/app/data \
# remove the below line (and this line) if you only use Qobuz/Tidal
  -v /your/path/to/Music:/music:ro \
  musicd-remote:1.6.35
```

Confirm the extension appears in **Roon → Settings → Extensions** before removing the old install.

### Cleaning up the old install

```bash
# Remove the service file
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/roon-random-albums.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Remove the old native install directory (find it first if unsure)
find / -name "roon-random-albums" -type d 2>/dev/null
rm -rf /path/to/old/roon-random-albums
```

Your Roon pairing, listening history, and label cache are all safe — they live in the Docker volume (`roon-random-albums-data`).

# MacOS installs as follows

For macOS, the main requirement is to install Docker Desktop first, since Docker is not included with the operating system.

## 1. Install Docker Desktop
• Download Docker Desktop for Mac from:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
(Ensure you’re installing the correct version for Mac or Intel chips)
• Open the downloaded .dmg.
• Drag Docker.app into your Applications folder.
• Launch Docker from Applications.
• Grant any permissions macOS requests.
• Wait until Docker Desktop reports Engine running (the whale icon in the menu bar will stop animating).
• Verify Docker is installed:

```
docker --version
docker compose version
```

You should see version information for both commands.

## 2. Download and build the extension
Open Terminal and run:

```
mkdir -p ~/musicd-remote
cd ~/musicd-remote
curl -L -o MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz \
https://github.com/meltface-80/MusicD-Remote/releases/download/v1.6.35/MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz
tar -xzf MusicD-Remote-v1.6.35.tar.gz
docker build -t musicd-remote:1.6.35 .
```

## 3. Run the container
If you use local music replace /Users/yourusername/Music with the folder containing your music library. Note: add your Roon server IP. 

```
docker run -d \
  --name musicd-remote \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3399:3399 \
  -e ROON_CORE_IP=<IP_OF_YOUR_ROON_CORE> \
  -v musicd-remote-data:/app/data \
  -v /Users/yourusername/Music:/music:ro \
  musicd-remote:1.6.35
```

Or if you only use Qobuz or TIDAL

```
docker run -d \
  --name musicd-remote \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3399:3399 \
  -e ROON_CORE_IP=<IP_OF_YOUR_ROON_CORE> \
  -v musicd-remote-data:/app/data \
  musicd-remote:1.6.35
```

## 4. Open the extension
In your browser, go to: (don’t forget to use your Roon server IP address)

`http://<your.server.IP>:3399`

Please let me know if you run into any trouble.

## Configuration

| Env var      | Default   | What it does |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| `PORT`       | `3399`    | HTTP port the UI listens on |
| `RRA_DEBUG`  | —         | Set to `1` for verbose logging |
| `MUSIC_DIR`  | `/music`  | Path where your music library is mounted inside the container |
| `ROON_CORE_IP` | *(discover)* | Roon Core address, for setups where multicast discovery can't reach it (macOS / Docker Desktop). When set, the extension connects to the Core directly instead of discovering it |
| `ROON_CORE_PORT` | `9330` | Roon Core API port used with `ROON_CORE_IP` — only change it if your Core runs its API on a non-standard port |

Pass extra env vars with `-e` in the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d ... -e RRA_DEBUG=1 musicd-remote:1.6.35
```

### Album metadata sources

No keys required for basic operation. The extension pulls in external metadata from:

- **Release year** — MusicBrainz (free, public API)
- **Label name** — file tags → Bandcamp (for Bandcamp purchases) → iTunes → TheAudioDB → MusicBrainz → Discogs (each free; Discogs needs a personal access token for best results)
- **Label logo** — FanArt.tv (requires free API key) → Discogs (requires personal access token)
- **Editorial review** — Qobuz public album page, falling back to Wikipedia
- **Artist bio** — Wikipedia

## Troubleshooting

- **"Waiting for Roon Core" never goes away**
  → Roon → Settings → Extensions → click **Enable** on *Random Albums*.
- **Extension shows "self" instead of "MusicD"**
  → Update to v1.5.31 or later.
- **Play Now does nothing**
  → Confirm a real zone is selected in the Settings dropdown.
- **"No zones available"**
  → No active outputs visible to Roon yet. Wake a device or pick one in Roon's own remote first.
- **Labels page shows no logos**
  → Add your Discogs token and FanArt.tv key in Settings (gear icon), then tap Force rescan.
- **Discogs token save doesn't stick**
  → Ensure the field shows your token in plain text before tapping Save. If it still fails, check `docker logs musicd-remote` for a confirmation line.
