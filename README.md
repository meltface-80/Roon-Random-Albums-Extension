# Random Albums — a Roon extension

A web UI that shows a screenful of random albums from your Roon library, with
playback actions targeting any of your zones. Includes instant whole-library
search, listening statistics, smart radio, and more.

> The Roon API does not let third-party code navigate the Roon app itself, so
> the album detail view (art, tracks, action buttons) is rendered inside this
> UI. Tapping **Play Now** still plays through Roon on the zone you select.

## Install (Docker)

Each release ships a `*-docker.tar.gz`. Download it, build the image, and run:

```bash
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/raw/main/roon-random-albums-v1.6.1-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-v1.6.1-docker.tar.gz
cd roon-random-albums
docker build -t roon-random-albums:1.6.1 .
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
  roon-random-albums:1.6.1
```

`--network host` is required so the extension can discover your Roon Core on
the local network. The `-v` flag mounts a named Docker volume so that your
Roon pairing, play history, and label cache survive container rebuilds.

You should see the extension appear in **Roon → Settings → Extensions** under
**MusicD**. Click **Enable**, then browse to `http://<your-server-ip>:3399`.

### Install Docker

If Docker isn't installed yet:

```bash
# DietPi
sudo dietpi-software install 162

# Debian / Ubuntu
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

## Migrating from a native install

If you're running an older native (non-Docker) install, the app will show a
migration banner automatically with copy-ready commands. Or follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Download and build the Docker image
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/raw/main/roon-random-albums-v1.6.1-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-v1.6.1-docker.tar.gz
cd roon-random-albums
docker build -t roon-random-albums:1.6.1 .

# 2. Run the Docker container
docker run -d \
  --name roon-random-albums \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data \
  roon-random-albums:1.6.1

# 3. Stop and disable the native service
sudo systemctl stop roon-random-albums
sudo systemctl disable roon-random-albums
```

## Updating

Updates are detected automatically on startup and every 6 hours. Install with
one tap from **Settings → Check for updates** in the web UI, or wait for the
update toast to appear. The container restarts itself to apply the update.

To force an immediate check:

```bash
docker restart roon-random-albums
```

To upgrade manually:

```bash
docker stop roon-random-albums && docker rm roon-random-albums
wget https://github.com/meltface-80/Roon-Random-Albums-Extension/raw/main/roon-random-albums-v{NEW_VERSION}-docker.tar.gz
tar -xzf roon-random-albums-v{NEW_VERSION}-docker.tar.gz
cd roon-random-albums
docker build -t roon-random-albums:{NEW_VERSION} .
docker run -d --name roon-random-albums --restart unless-stopped --network host -v roon-random-albums-data:/app/data roon-random-albums:{NEW_VERSION}
```

## Configuration

| Env var     | Default | What it does |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `PORT`      | `3399`  | HTTP port the UI listens on |
| `RRA_DEBUG` | —       | Set to `1` for verbose logging |

Pass extra env vars with `-e` in the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -d ... -e RRA_DEBUG=1 roon-random-albums:1.6.1
```

### Album metadata sources

No keys required. The extension pulls in three pieces of external metadata:

- **Release year** — MusicBrainz (free, public API).
- **Album editorial review** — scraped from the public Qobuz album page when
  it exists; falls back to the Wikipedia article's intro paragraph.
- **Artist bio** — Wikipedia article intro.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Waiting for Roon Core" never goes away**
  → Roon → Settings → Extensions → click **Enable** on *Random Albums*.
- **Extension shows "self" instead of "MusicD"**
  → Update to v1.6.1 or later.
- **Play Now does nothing**
  → Confirm a real zone is selected in the Settings dropdown.
- **"No zones available"**
  → No active outputs visible to Roon yet. Wake a device or pick one in
  Roon's own remote first.
- **Stats page is blank**
  → Stats need at least one track to start playing after v1.5.27 is installed.
  The "Recently played" section appears as soon as any track starts.
- **Update fails with "extraction failed"**
  → The container image may be old; rebuild using the steps in the Updating
  section above. From v1.5.9 onward this is fixed automatically.
