# Claude Code — Project Rules for Roon Random Albums Extension

Read this file at the start of every session. These rules are permanent and override any
default behaviours. Do not deviate from them unless the user explicitly says so in that session.

---

## ZERO-TOLERANCE QUALITY MANDATE

**Regressions are not acceptable. Bugs introduced by a change are a failure, not a follow-up task.**

### Agent workflow — run for every non-trivial change

Every change must pass through all four agents before committing:

1. **Architect Agent** — scan files, map side effects, verify the change won't break adjacent behaviour or mobile rendering.
2. **Reviewer Agent** — ensure the change handles edge cases, empty states, and errors safely.
3. **Developer Agent** — apply complete, production-grade code. No inline placeholders (`// ...` or `// rest stays the same`).
4. **QA Agent** — execute the pre-flight checks below, verify pass status, and report results clearly.

Keep output compact — no wall-of-text explanations. Tag results clearly: `[PASS]` or `[FAIL] reason`.

### Mandatory pre-flight before every commit

Run these in order. Do not commit if any step fails.

```bash
# 1. Syntax check — catches crashes before they happen
node --check index.js

# 2. Variable name consistency — grep for UPPER_SNAKE leftovers
#    (catches the DISCOGS_TOKEN vs discogsToken class of bug)
grep -n 'DISCOGS_TOKEN\|FANART_TV_KEY' index.js && echo "ERROR: stale constant name" || echo "OK"

# 3. Temporal dead zone audit — every `let`/`const` must appear BEFORE
#    any bare assignment to the same name at module level
#    (catches the v1.5.66 startup crash class of bug)
node -e "require('./index.js')" 2>&1 | head -5
```

If step 3 cannot run (Roon not available), run steps 1 and 2 and explicitly note why 3 was skipped.

### Pre-flight checklist (tick each before every push)

- [ ] `node --check index.js` exits 0
- [ ] No `let x` declared after a bare `x = ...` assignment at module scope
- [ ] Every variable referenced matches its exact declaration name (no UPPER_SNAKE drift)
- [ ] Every new `catch (e) {}` is intentional — not swallowing a symptom
- [ ] Auth headers reference the live variable, not a deleted constant
- [ ] Any new HTML element ID matches the `getElementById` call in app.js exactly
- [ ] `package.json` version bumped
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md entry added

### Development rules

- **No incomplete implementations.** Write the full code. Never leave `// rest stays the same`.
- **No silent catch.** `catch (e) {}` must have a comment explaining why silence is safe.
- **Variable name freeze.** Once a variable is named, all references — declaration, assignment, template literals, log messages — use the identical name. Never mix camelCase and UPPER_SNAKE for the same value.
- **Declaration before use.** With `let`/`const` in Node.js, a bare assignment `x = val` on line N while `let x` is on line N+500 is a ReferenceError. Always declare at the first-use site.
- **No partial migrations.** When renaming a constant or moving it to settings, search the entire file with grep before committing to ensure zero stale references remain.

### When a bug is found

1. Identify the root cause (not the symptom).
2. Confirm the root cause explains ALL reported failures.
3. Fix the root cause, not the symptom.
4. Add the relevant pre-flight check above if one would have caught it.
5. Document what class of error it was in the CHANGELOG.

---

## Code review workflow (multi-agent)

For any non-trivial change, run a full code review using parallel agents before committing. The `/code-review --effort high` skill automates this. It must be run on any change that touches:
- The label scan pipeline (`runLabelsIndexScan`, `buildFileLabelMap`, pass logic)
- Discogs or FanArt.tv API integration
- Settings persistence (`savePersistedSettings`, `loadPersistedSettings`)
- New UI components in `public/app.js` or `public/index.html`

### Review angles (run in parallel via Agent tool)

Spawn all 8 angles simultaneously, then verify surviving candidates:

| Angle | What it hunts |
|-------|---------------|
| A — line-by-line diff scan | Inverted conditions, null deref, missing await, wrong variable |
| B — removed-behavior auditor | Dropped guards, deleted error paths, narrowed validation |
| C — cross-file tracer | Broken call sites, mismatched request/response shapes |
| D — reuse | Code that re-implements an existing helper |
| E — simplification | Redundant state, dead code, unnecessary nesting |
| F — efficiency | Sync I/O on hot paths, redundant computation |
| G — altitude | Bandaids layered on shared infrastructure |
| H — CLAUDE.md conventions | Quote the exact rule and exact violating line |

### Verify findings

For each surviving candidate, spawn one verifier agent and get: **CONFIRMED / PLAUSIBLE / REFUTED**.
- PLAUSIBLE by default — do not refute without quoting code that proves it impossible.
- REFUTED only when the code provably makes it unreachable.
- Keep CONFIRMED and PLAUSIBLE. Drop REFUTED.

### Fix all confirmed findings before committing

Do not commit with known CONFIRMED or PLAUSIBLE bugs. Fix them all in the same version bump.

---

## Repository — branch + PR workflow

- Develop on a **feature branch** of `meltface-80/MusicD-Remote` (e.g. `claude/<topic>`). Never commit directly to `main`.
- For each change: commit to the branch, build and **commit the tarball to the branch** (see below), push, and give the user the docker install command for the branch build. The user tests the branch build, then opens and merges the PR themselves.
- **Never open or merge a pull request yourself** unless the user explicitly asks. The user merges.
- **When the user says "merged", it means merged AND the release is published as latest** —
  run the promotion pass immediately without asking: bump every README version reference,
  the docs-site fallback version/examples, and this file's current-stable note + version
  history table, as a docs-only commit on the freshly-restarted branch. (Established
  2026-07-14; the user should not have to say "promote to latest" separately.)
- The `old/` folder contains two permanent historical tarballs (v1.5.37 and v1.5.49). **Do not add to or remove from this folder.**

---

## Every build — required steps (in order)

**Docs-only exception:** a change that touches only `docs/` (the GitHub Pages site) and/or
repo documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) is NOT a build. It skips the
version bump, the CHANGELOG entry, the tarball rebuild, and the docker install command —
`docs/` is excluded from the tarball and is never part of the running extension. Pre-flight
steps 1–2 still run (they are cheap and index.js must stay untouched), and the change still
gets a normal review before commit. The v1.6.36 bump for the original docs page was reverted
for exactly this reason — do not repeat it.

1. Make code changes
2. Bump `package.json` version
3. Add a CHANGELOG.md entry (see format below)
4. Run pre-flight checks (see above)
5. Build the tarball and place it at the repo root, replacing the previous version's tarball (`git rm` the old one, `git add` the new one)
6. Commit in a single commit: code + `package.json` + `CHANGELOG.md` + the new tarball
7. Push to the feature branch
8. Give the user the docker install command for the branch build (see template below)

**Commit the tarball to the branch.** Downloading it from GitHub (raw) is byte-exact; routing it through Dropbox/cloud storage corrupted the archive. Keep only the current version's tarball in the repo — replace it each build.

---

## Building and delivering the tarball

Build the tarball to `/tmp` first (so `tar` doesn't include the output file mid-write), then copy
it to the repo root and commit it to the branch. **Do not send it through Dropbox/cloud storage —
that corrupted the archive.** The user downloads it byte-exact from GitHub raw.

```bash
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
TARBALL="MusicD-Remote-v${VERSION}.tar.gz"
tar -czf "/tmp/${TARBALL}" \
  --exclude='./.git' \
  --exclude='./node_modules' \
  --exclude='./old' \
  --exclude='./data' \
  --exclude='./docs' \
  --exclude='./*.tar.gz' \
  .
cp "/tmp/${TARBALL}" "./${TARBALL}"
git rm -q MusicD-Remote-v<PREVIOUS>.tar.gz   # drop the old branch tarball
git add "${TARBALL}"
```

Commit the tarball with the rest of the change, push the branch, then give the user the docker
install command (see template below) using the GitHub **raw** URL for the tarball on the branch.

---

## GitHub releases — user-controlled

The user manually publishes releases on GitHub when they are satisfied with testing.

- **Never create a GitHub release yourself.**
- **Never change the latest/pre-release status yourself.**
- The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) still exists but is not
  relied upon for the build/test cycle.

---

## README.md — frozen until told otherwise

- The README contains version references (install commands, tarball URLs, `docker build` tags).
- **Do not change any version number in README.md** unless the user explicitly says
  "promote to latest" or "update the README".
- Current stable version in the README: **v1.6.51** (until the user says otherwise).
- The extension is being renamed **MusicD Remote** ("for Roon" is descriptive, not part of the name). The Roon `extension_id` must NEVER change — it would force every user to re-authorize.

---

## CHANGELOG.md format

Add a new section at the top, above the previous version:

```
## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD

### Added / Fixed / Changed
- Description of change
```

---

## After each build — docker install command template

After pushing the branch, give this command with the version and branch filled in. It downloads
the tarball byte-exact from GitHub raw (no Dropbox). Drop the `/music` mount line when the user
is testing a Qobuz/Tidal streaming-only scenario.

```bash
sudo docker stop musicd-remote
sudo docker rm musicd-remote
sudo rm -f /opt/musicd-remote/MusicD-Remote-vPREVIOUS.tar.gz
cd /opt/musicd-remote
wget -O MusicD-Remote-vNEW.tar.gz \
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meltface-80/MusicD-Remote/refs/heads/<BRANCH>/MusicD-Remote-vNEW.tar.gz"
file MusicD-Remote-vNEW.tar.gz   # expect: gzip compressed data
tar -xzf MusicD-Remote-vNEW.tar.gz
docker build -t musicd-remote:NEW .
docker run -d \
  --name musicd-remote \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -v musicd-remote-data:/app/data \
  -v /mnt/dietpi_userdata/4tb/Music:/music:ro \
  musicd-remote:NEW
# NOTE: the volume holds the Roon pairing + history. New installs (and the
# user's box, after the one-time v1.6.32 copy migration) use
# musicd-remote-data; pre-v1.6.32 installs must copy roon-random-albums-data
# into it once (see README Updating) — a wrong/renamed volume silently
# starts empty (re-pairing, lost history).
```
